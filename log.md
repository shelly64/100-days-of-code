### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** picked up old files and ran the hello world version of app

**Thoughts:** I should have created the Readme file earlier, so that I would not need to go through what I had been through again, lol. Will update setup steps every time accordingly, since that will same more time in the future~~~~
And, most important thing is that I'm feeling really great about this challenge!!
