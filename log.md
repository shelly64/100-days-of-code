### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** picked up old files and ran the hello world version of app

**Thoughts:** I should have created the Readme file earlier, so that I would not need to go through what I had been through again, lol. Will update setup steps every time accordingly, since that will same more time in the future~~~~
And, most important thing is that I'm feeling really great about this challenge!!

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Registered the app using a customized class and started working the Input Form of a topic

**Thoughts:** Work slowly because the design work hasn't done properly. Had to spend some time on thinking what to do hand how to do.

**Question:** when I register the app in `index.ios.js`, it works with path `./js/FlockApp.js` but doesn't work with `Flock/client/js/FlockApp.js`. Why?
